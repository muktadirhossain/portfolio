My Journey in Development

With 3.5 years of dedicated experience, I specialize in building robust and scalable applications using React, React Native, Next.js, and the MERN stack. My passion lies in bringing ideas to life through clean, efficient code.

Beyond coding, I excel in UI/UX design with Figma, ensuring every project is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. I handle projects end-to-end, from initial concept to final deployment.

I'm now venturing into freelancing, eager to collaborate on exciting new projects and deliver exceptional digital experiences. Let's build something amazing together!
